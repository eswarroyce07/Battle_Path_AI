📘 Overview

BattlePath AI is an AI-powered tactical pathfinding system designed to simulate intelligent troop movement in a battlefield environment.
It uses Game AI techniques and heuristic algorithms like A* pathfinding integrated with risk-based modeling to determine the safest or most efficient route from a start point to a target while avoiding enemy zones and high-risk areas.

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be applied to real-time strategy, military simulation, and autonomous decision-making.
